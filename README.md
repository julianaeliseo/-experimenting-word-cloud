# -experimenting-word-cloud

I saw a very interesting post from Karan Bhanot ("Identify the main topics using Word Cloud"). 
It is a very introductory post about Word Cloud, quite easy to read. 
And after reading I decided to try Word Cloud, 
I tried the Kaggle dataset on news from Brazilian newspapers. 
It proved to be really useful and practical. You can easily deduce what are the trending topics anywhere. 
But of course, this is just my obvious observation. It has many other applications.

This is the link for Karan's post: "  https://towardsdatascience.com/identify-top-topics-using-word-cloud-9c54bc84d911  "
Thank you, Karan Bhanot!
